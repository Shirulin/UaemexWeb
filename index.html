    <h2>ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)</h2>
    <p>
      Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a type of digital subscriber line (DSL) technology, 
      a data communications technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines 
      than a conventional voiceband modem can provide.
    </p>

    <h3>Operating Principles</h3>
    <p>
      The key characteristic of ADSL is that it utilizes the existing twisted-pair copper telephone lines 
      to deliver high-speed internet access without interrupting regular telephone service. 
      This is achieved through frequency division multiplexing (FDM).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frequency Separation:</strong> A standard telephone line has a much wider frequency range capacity than what is used for voice calls. Voice communication uses the 0-4 kHz frequency band. ADSL technology takes advantage of the unused higher frequencies to transmit data.</li>
      <li><strong>Data and Voice Channels:</strong> The available frequency spectrum is divided into:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service):</strong> 0–4 kHz reserved for voice calls.</li>
          <li><strong>Upstream Data:</strong> Medium frequencies for uploading data.</li>
          <li><strong>Downstream Data:</strong> Higher frequencies for downloading data.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Asymmetric Nature:</strong> Download speeds are much higher than upload speeds, fitting typical user behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FTTH (Fiber to the Home)</h2>
    <p>
      Fiber to the Home (FTTH) is the delivery of a communications signal over optical fiber 
      from the operator's switching equipment all the way to a home or business, 
      replacing existing copper infrastructure such as telephone wires and coaxial cable.
    </p>

    <h3>Operating Principles</h3>
    <p>
      FTTH is fundamentally different from ADSL because it uses fiber-optic cables instead of copper wires. 
      Data is transmitted as pulses of light, which allows for incredibly high speeds and signal quality 
      over long distances.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Transmission via Light:</strong> Information is encoded into light pulses from lasers or LEDs.</li>
      <li><strong>Total Internal Reflection:</strong> Signals travel inside the fiber with minimal loss over distance.</li>
      <li><strong>Active vs. Passive Optical Networks:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AON:</strong> Dedicated fiber per customer, electrically powered switches.</li>
          <li><strong>PON:</strong> Shared fiber split to multiple users, more cost-effective.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Symmetric Speeds:</strong> Upload and download speeds are equal, perfect for video calls, cloud storage, and gaming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Team Conclusions</h2>
    <ul class="conclusion-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Oscar Ivan Gonzalez Becerra:</strong> Creating this website about ADSL and FTTH on GitHub was very enriching. I learned how to collaborate with others, manage tasks, and use version control more effectively. Writing everything in English improved my technical vocabulary and my ability to describe telecommunications concepts. I was pleased to see that, through a simple design, we managed to communicate precise and useful information. Upon completion, I felt motivated to continue web development and participate in more collaborative projects, and I was satisfied with the result.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ivan Lex Alvarez Vargas:</strong> After analyzing the operational principles of both technologies, 
        it's clear that while ADSL was a pivotal innovation for bringing broadband internet to the masses by leveraging 
        existing telephone infrastructure, its limitations are inherent to its copper-based medium. 
        In contrast, FTTH represents a fundamental leap forward, offering symmetric speeds, reliability, and scalability 
        for future applications like 8K streaming and IoT. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Josephat Shiru Olvera Avila:</strong> After learning about ADSL and FTTH, I realized that the internet we use 	depends a lot on the technology that transmits it. ADSL was very important because it allowed us to have internet using 	the same telephone cables, but it is slower and loses quality if you live far away. FTTH, on the other hand, uses fiber 	optics and is much better because the information travels with light, which makes the connection faster, more stable, and 	with the same speed for uploading and downloading files. Therefore, although ADSL was very useful at the time, FTTH is 	the technology we need now and in the future to be able to study, play online, or work without problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blancas Badillo Gema:</strong> Understanding the operating principles of ADSL and FTTH allows us to appreciate 	how internet access has evolved. ADSL was a practical solution that maximized the existing copper infrastructure, making 	broadband widely available at a relatively low cost. However, its limitations in speed and reliability make it less 	suitable for today’s digital demands. In contrast, FTTH represents the future of connectivity, offering high capacity, 	low latency, and long-term scalability. This comparison highlights that while ADSL opened the door to broadband, FTTH 	ensures that door stays wide open for future innovation and growing data needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Itzel Martinez Lopez:</strong> The development of this web page allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the 	operating principles of ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) and FTTH (Fiber To The Home) technologies. Through 	comparative analysis and research from reliable sources, we found that while ADSL represents an affordable and widely 	used solution for Internet access over copper telephone lines, FTTH provides a more modern and efficient infrastructure 	based on fiber optics, offering higher transfer speeds and better quality of service.
